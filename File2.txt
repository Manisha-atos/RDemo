Welcome to Branch Demo
In Git, cloning is the act of making a copy of any target repository. 
The target repository can be remote or local. You can clone your repository from the remote repository 
to create a local copy on your system. Also, you can sync between the two locations.
$ git clone https://github.com/Manisha-atos/NewRepo.git 


=======================Branching =======================

Branch --another line of development.
default is the Master Branch .
we can create a duplicate copy of current branch do the new changes and then update the original branch

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
